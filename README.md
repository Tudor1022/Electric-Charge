This is an amateur project in which I used Flask framework from Python to create a platform dedicated to electric car owners.

Overview on "Electric Charge":
This is a platform where every EV enthusiast can join and have every essential functionality to help him choose his best EV or mantain his EV. These are the functionalities of the website:
  1. community where each member can post about problems, advice, etc., and other users can interact 
  2. news page with articles about news in the world
  3. chatbot that uses an ai api, to answer all users' questions
  4. Function to compare electric cars to be able to make the best decision in buying them
  5. EV parts marketplace with products from ampervolt.com (search for products and it takes you to their page, and if the user buys we get a commission  !!! this artnerships is ficional !!!)
  6. try before you buy function where we have a partnership with representatives and car dealers who offer test drives for electric cars through our platform
  7. Map with charging stations around you
  8. guides, what you can do while your car is charging, map with surrounding attractions, maintenance guide, etc.
  9. useful tutorials for electric cars
  10. Calendar of events organized by us to create a networking community for electric cars

To create this website I used Flask framework, sql-alchemy for the small and local db, and HTML, CSS and JS. Flask framework was chosen for its simple style of routing the pages and template inheritance.
