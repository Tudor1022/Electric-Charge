This is an amateur project in which I used the Flask framework from Python to create a platform dedicated to electric car owners.

Overview of "Electric Charge":
This is a platform where every EV enthusiast can join and have every essential functionality to help him choose his best EV or maintain his EV. These are the functionalities of the website:
  1. community, where each member can post about problems, advice, etc., and other users, can interact 
  2. news page with articles about news in the world
  3. chatbot that uses an AI/ML API, to answer all users' questions
  4. Function to compare electric cars to be able to make the best decision in buying them
  5. EV parts marketplace with products from ampervolt.com (you search for products, and it takes you to their page. If the user buys, we get a commission! This partnership is fictional !!!)
  6. try before you buy function where we have a partnership with representatives and car dealers who offer test drives for electric cars through our platform
  7. Map with charging stations around you
  8. guides, what you can do while your car is charging, map with surrounding attractions, maintenance guide, etc.
  9. useful tutorials for electric cars
  10. Calendar of events organized by us to create a networking community for electric cars

To create this website, I used the Flask framework, SQL-alchemy for the small and local database, and HTML, CSS, and JS. The Flask framework was chosen for its simple page routing and template inheritance.
